# Image Encryption Tool

A simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic operations on pixel values, such as XOR operations and pixel swapping.

## Features

- Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values
- Decrypt encrypted images
- Supports different image modes (e.g., RGB, RGBA)
- Handles errors during image loading and saving

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

## Installation of Period library
```bash
pip install pillow
```
